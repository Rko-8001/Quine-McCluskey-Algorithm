					CS203 Project
Title: A c++ program to simplify Boolean expressions inspired by Karnaugh map.

Overall Objective: Basically, our program can simplify the Boolean algebra expression that user desire to minimize by using the concept of Karnaugh map.

Functionality:  
This project takes the input of number of Boolean variables from the user.
The user should enter the input either in form of min terms (SOP), max terms (POS) or can also enter the Boolean expression itself.
The program will make the k map of the given the expression, also the minimized form of the Boolean expression.

The program can be used as a software application. One can implement the same in web or in a mobile application.
